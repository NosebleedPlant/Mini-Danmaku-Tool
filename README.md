# Mini-Danmaku-Tool
Status: Close to completion

**Description:**

A bullethell pattern making tool for the godot game engine. The goal is to setup a system that allows designers to rapidly prototype bullethell patterns that they can then drop into levels for testing. The tool does not aim to include the ability to design movement patterns for the emitters or design generators for now in the interset of keeping the scope manageable for a 1-person project.
